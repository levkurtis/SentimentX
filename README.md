# SentimentX - Sentiment Analysis Tool using Tweets

This project is created as a collaboration with TechLabs Copenhagen. The purpose of the project was bringing students from the web-development, data science and AI track together on a project to collaborate on a program that can solve a real life problem.

The official Twitter Research API is beings utilized for this project. The reason why is because the Research API allows us to gather Tweets from different dates. This gives the program the functionality of gathering and analyzing the sentiment of Tweets from different time periods.
